`evovability` is an R-package for calculating evolvability parameters from G-matrices (see Hansen and Houle 2008  <doi:10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01573.x> and Bolstad et al. 2014 <doi:10.1098/rstb.2013.0255>) and for fitting phylogenetic comparative models that link the rate of evolution of a trait to the state of another evolving trait (see Hansen et al. 2020 in prep).

The package includes two vignettes. One for analyzing rates of evolution and one for fitting phylogenetic mixed models.

The latest version of the package can be downloaded by `devtools::install_github(repo = "GHBolstad/evolvability", build_vignettes = TRUE)`
